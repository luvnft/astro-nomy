# The Global Housing Crisis and the Role of Bitcoin's $RNT Token

The global housing market is facing a significant challenge: a shortage of affordable rental housing. This shortage is particularly acute in major cities, where the cost of rent has become increasingly unaffordable for many people.

The Bitcoin $RNT token draws a line in the sand to reveal what landlords are part of the housing crisis problem and part of the affording housing RNTal solution.

## $RNT Relief Solution Example

BlackRock is making $700M a day from Bitcoin ETFs. 

That equates to housing 309,932 people in a day by airdropping $RNT relief to 309,932 landlords at once using a Unisat.io wallet.

Problem solved. 

We can no longer say that we don't have a solution to creating affordable housing.

## $RNT Work

As a nation of states, we must unite to solve this problem we're all experiencing. As a solution to the job economy, we will reward our $RNTal community for promoting our solutions, onboarding landlords, managing our CRE CLUB Discord, and promoting properties that accept $RNT on social media.

Only 21M $RNT tokens will ever exist to solve the housing crisis.

## How $RNT Can Create Affordable Housing Rentals

There are several ways that $RNT can help to create affordable rentals:

- Accepting Bitcoin: Who doesn't want Bitcoin these days with the value at $67,795.00 today (3/7/24) on pace to hit $100k by the end of 2024? Landlords can create affordable housing rentals below market rate knowing that in the long run, Bitcoin will increase in value.
- Reduced transaction fees: Bitcoin transactions have much lower fees than traditional bank transfers. This means that landlords can save money on transaction costs when they accept $RNT for rent. These savings can be passed on to tenants in the form of lower rent payments.
- Increased flexibility: $RNT can be used to pay rent from anywhere in the world. This makes it easier for tenants to find affordable housing, even if they are not located in the same city as the landlord.
- Greater transparency: Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a public blockchain. This makes it easy for tenants to track their rent payments and ensure that they are being used for the intended purpose.
- Homelessness: I'm proposing to all USA city mayors to give tax credits to homeowners that house someone in need of somewhere to live. For every person housed, the homeowner receives one $RNT token per month. 

### Benefits for Landlords

In addition to the benefits for tenants, there are also several benefits for landlords who accept $RNT:
