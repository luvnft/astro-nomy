# The dollar is plummeting to $0

The dollar is plummeting to $0, and enough is not being done locally to prepare Americans for the currency transition from fiat to crypto which happens to be the only proven solution to countering inflation. 

## Solutions

**BLK LUV ORG**, an Atlanta-based blockchain nonprofit owned by a married couple named Hahz, also known as The Wizard of Hahz, and Dr. Candy, built a solution for Atlanta with $0 grants or funding to educate residents and businesses on how to unite and save themselves by onboarding to the digital D-commerce economy starting by subscribing to the ATL5D Discord. The Wizard of Hahz is a blockchain thought leader who pioneered tokenizing real estate mapped to a physical property in 2021. He has spoken at blockchain conferences and has led multimillion-dollar blockchain projects, including The World Series of Poker, Audiomack, HULU, and LUV NFT.
