# Atlanta's Unbanked Population

Atlanta, Georgia, has a significant population of unbanked households, estimated to be around 10%. This means that approximately 100,000 Atlanta residents do not have access to traditional banking services such as checking or savings accounts.

The reasons for being unbanked vary, but common factors include:

- Low income
- Lack of identification
- Negative banking history
- Distrust of banks
