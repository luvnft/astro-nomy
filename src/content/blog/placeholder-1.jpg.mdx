# Racial Gap Problem

"The typical value of U.S. homes with Black owners ($291,000) is 18% less than the typical value of homes with white owners ($354,000), per data Zillow exclusively shared with Axios.

**Why it matters:** Homeownership remains the biggest driver of the wealth gap, per the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. 

**The big picture:** This value gap is widest in Birmingham, Alabama; Detroit; St. Louis; Bridgeport, Connecticut; and Buffalo, New York.

Black owners seeing their homes appraising for less than those of their white counterparts isn't new. "It's no longer a myth or legend that this happens," U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Chief of Staff Julienne Joseph, MBA tells Axios."

At KeepinglyÂ® we just unveiled our solution to the Appraisal Bias conversation - Appraiser's Edge - Transforming Property Appraisal: Our solution redefines the property appraisal process by actively involving homeowners and integrating property maintenance and capital upgrades. Appraiser's Edge empowers homeowners, reduces bias, and standardizes documentation, leading to more accurate and transparent appraisals.

## The Bigger Problem

After successfully addressing DEI, REJ, and systemic racism through blockchain technology, as explained here, and reaching out to potential partners for our blockchain nonprofit, only to receive no response, we've come to realize a larger issue within humanity.

Firstly, there's a misconception that these longstanding issues can be resolved solely through advanced technology.

Secondly, we've observed that some businesses are profiting from major societal problems through Web2 donations, selling ads in news articles, or running PR campaigns targeting people of color who are directly impacted by these issues.

Historically, solutions have been created from the business model of the source of the problem, so when a third party presents a solution that disrupts the status quo, it can be met with resistance. This is because the incumbent businesses have a vested interest in maintaining the current system, even if it is not the most efficient or beneficial for the end user.

For example, it took 10 years for Bitcoin to be adopted by the traditional financial system and other financial institutions. These institutions make money by charging fees for their services, such as lending money, processing payments, and managing investments. As a result, they have little incentive to innovate or to develop new solutions that could disrupt their existing business models.

This is where third-party providers can come in and offer innovative solutions that challenge the status quo. However, these third-party providers often face resistance from the incumbent businesses, who may try to block their entry into the market or discredit their solutions.

Despite the challenges, third-party providers can be successful in disrupting the status quo if they can offer a better solution for the end user. For example, the rise of fintech companies has led to several innovative new financial products and services that are more convenient, affordable, and accessible than traditional banking products.

Another example is the rise of open-source software. Open source software is software that is freely available to anyone to use, modify, and distribute. This has led to the development of several innovative new software applications that are more powerful and flexible than proprietary software. The resistance from open source software results in traditional Fortune 100 companies patenting the code to prevent the public use of the free code.

## The Bigger Solution

Throughout our four-year journey of using blockchain tech for good with no funding, we documented and tokenized every grant we applied for, the decline letters, screenshots of every contact made to present our solution to a company that publicly presented that they are for the cause solving the issue to present a blockchain case study of who's really for purpose or profit. Stay tuned as we keep you informed on who partners with us to solve the racial gap in home values.
