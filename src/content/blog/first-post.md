### Food Affordability Solution

Food waste is a major problem in the United States, with an estimated 108 billion pounds of food wasted each year. This not only hurts the environment but also represents a significant loss of money for restaurants and other food businesses.

One way to reduce food waste is to tokenize it as a LUV NFT (non-fungible token).

The solution is simple, take a picture of the food that will be converted into an LUV NFT. Here's how it works:

1. Restaurants and food businesses tokenize their surplus food as LUV NFTs.
2. LUV NFTs are airdropped to local residents in need or auctioned for a fraction of the original cost to create a new crypto income stream for businesses in the food industry to offset increasing food costs.
3. Recipients of a LUV NFT can go to a participating local business to pick up food at the end of the night.
4. To claim their food, recipients simply show their LUV NFT with a What3Words address, date, and time to claim the food.

### Purpose Marketing Campaign

Many small businesses in the food industry are failing because they don't have the capital to spend thousands a month on digital marketing campaigns to compete with funded businesses.

As a solution, residents who want to win free tokenized LUV NFT food airdrops must promote small businesses on social media participating in the solution.

### Benefits of Tokenizing Food Waste as LUV NFTs:

- Reduces food waste and its negative environmental impact.
- Saves restaurants and food businesses money.
- Helps to feed residents in need.
- Provides organic marketing for participating businesses.
- We can feed the homeless by paying volunteers in crypto to drive around and hand out food every night.
