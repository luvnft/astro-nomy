# Tokenization Explained

Tokenization involves converting tangible assets, such as real estate, art, commodities, and intellectual property, as well as non-tangible assets like images, audio, and video, into digital tokens stored on a blockchain or distributed ledger technology. This digitization enhances liquidity, transparency, and accessibility, revolutionizing traditional financial markets.

## Benefits of Tokenization

- **Enhanced Liquidity**: Tokenized assets can be traded 24/7 on cryptocurrency exchanges, unlike traditional markets with limited trading hours.
- **Increased Transparency**: Blockchain technology provides immutable records, reducing fraud and ownership disputes.
- **Reduced Costs**: Tokenization eliminates paperwork, middlemen, and legal fees, lowering investor expenses.
- **Security**: Digital assets mitigate Web2 scams involving fiat, AI cloning content, and cultural exploitation on social media.

## Tokenized African American Legacy

The African-American legacy was devalued on Web1 and Web2 because middlemen could earn more ROI, similar to a pawn shop's business model. Arvrtise ATL5D is tokenizing Atlanta's devalued history as D-commerce the world can buy and sell.

> "Blockchain allows our culture to tokenize and own our history. We no longer have to wait for a gatekeeper or media channel to tell us how much our history is worth. This is the last Black History Month; I established BLK History Year on the Blockchain. We will tokenize history in real-time daily and tell our stories in our LUV NFT Discord. As a solution to the lack of diversity in traditional award shows, we are going to announce the launch of the Metaverse Osiris Award show in 2024." - The Wizard of Hahz

## Tokenized Jobs

AI will replace a majority of our workforce in the for-profit economy. As a solution, ATL5D is tokenizing jobs as NFTs in the for-purpose economy, solving the broken traditional hiring process and providing trust and transparency with job services on-chain. Anyone who subscribes to ATL5D Discord can tokenize their service.

### Example:

Uber drivers on strike for unfair pay can tokenize their service by creating 100 LUV NFTs. Potential passengers can read previous reviews, chat with the driver, and search their LUV NFT contract on the blockchain. Drivers can offer a flat fee for all trips, attracting new services like Fiverr, with transparent costs for passengers.

## Tokenized ATL5D Podcasts

Podcasts are often too long, and platforms like Apple take 30% of the revenue. ATL5D Podcasts are short, and podcasters earn 100%. Sponsor ads are logos and Web2 domains converted to 3 words, displayed on the NFT image of the LUV NFT Podcast.

ATL5D Discord allows subscribers to build their podcast fanbase by tokenizing audio podcast highlights as LUV NFTs, giving listeners the first rights to owning a piece of the show. Podcasters can create exclusive ATLverse events for listeners holding a piece of their show in their crypto wallet as an event key.

## Tokenized Audio

AI can clone a voice with just a 3-second clip. Tokenizing audio is essential to prevent AI from cloning your voice or audio. For musicians, tokenizing audio offers a solution to signing traditional content agreements that undervalue their music.  

## Tokenizing Video

Tokenized video operates on a model where one NFT can potentially sell for millions, unlike YouTube's CPM ad revenue model which averages $2-$12 per 1000 impressions. LUV NFT takes 0% revenue share, offering creators full control and transparency over their monetization.

- **Control over Monetization**: Creators set their prices and revenue shares.
