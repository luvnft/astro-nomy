# ATL5D Launches ATL5D TV: Empowering Local Businesses and Creators with D-commerce and Bitcoin Rewards

Atlanta-based tech startup ATL5D has unveiled ATL5D BET (Bitcoin Entertainment TV), a groundbreaking platform that revolutionizes the way local businesses connect with influencers and creators. This innovative platform solves several key challenges faced by both businesses and creators, fostering a mutually beneficial ecosystem. 

BET is a revolutionary platform that pays subscribers a transparent flat fee of $20 in Bitcoin L$VE for every 10K video views. This is a significant departure from YouTube's model, which only pays a maximum of $10 for top-tier content creators that hit 10K video views.

BET's L$VE token is the new "like" button on the platform. When viewers like a video, they can reward the creator with Bitcoin L$VE directly in the ATL5D Discord with the BET video @username matching the creators ATL5D Discord username. This allows fans to directly support their favorite creators and ensures that creators are fairly compensated for their work.

BET launched in the Atlanta twin digital market called ATL5D, which allows ATL5D Discord subscribers to promote the D-commerce with the ability to download videos that can be tokenized as a D-commerce in the ATL5D Discord as a same-day service. This innovative approach to D-commerce solves the problem of underpaid YouTube creators by providing them with a new way to monetize their content.

The launch of BET comes at a time when YouTube creators are increasingly vocal about being underpaid. In recent months, several high-profile creators have left YouTube for other platforms, citing unfair compensation as a major factor. BET's transparent and fair payment model is a welcome change for creators who are tired of being taken advantage of by YouTube.
